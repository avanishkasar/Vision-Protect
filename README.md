# 🔥 How Vision Protect Works
Real-time Face Detection: Scans how close your face is to the screen.

Screen Protection: Blurs or blacks out the display if you get too close.

Lightweight + Fast: Built with CameraX and ML Kit to ensure minimal lag and battery impact.

Modern UI: Clean, easy-to-use interface with onboarding tutorial and social links.

Privacy First: No data collected or shared. Detection happens 100% on your device.
